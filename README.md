## Michroma

Michroma is a reworking and remodelling of the rounded-square sans genre that is closely associated with a 1960s feeling of the future. This is due to the popularity of Microgramma, designed by Aldo Novarese and Alessandro Buttiin in 1952, which pioneered the style; and the most famous typeface family of the genre that came 10 years later in Novareseâ€™s Eurostile.

Michroma has character widths and stem weights perfectly formed to fit today's digital screens; Vernon Adams has pioneered a design process with this font that produces excellent results on screen with no manual hinting involved.
